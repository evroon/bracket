## I ran Bracket with the default `docker-compose.yml` but I can't connect to the backend?

This is likely because you are trying to access Bracket on a different address than
`http://localhost:3000` in the browser. In that case, two things need to be changed:

- Change `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` to the address of the backend, e.g `https://api.example.org`.
- You will also need to update `CORS_ORIGINS` to the address of the frontend, e.g.
  `https://app.example.org`.

Please consult [configuration docs](configuration.mdx) for more information.
