# Contributing

If you're using Bracket and would like to help support its development, that would be greatly
appreciated!

Several areas that we need a bit of help with at the moment are:

- ‚≠ê **Star Bracket** on GitHub
- üåê **Translating**: Help make Bracket available to non-native English speakers by adding your
  language. See [Translating](#translating) below.
- üì£ **Spread the word** by sharing Bracket to help new users discover it
- üñ•Ô∏è **Submit a PR** to add a new feature, fix a bug, extend/update the docs or something else

## Translating

### Adding translations (via crowdin)

Bracket uses [crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/bracket) for translations. You can add/improve
translations here in your language.

If you want to add a new language, please create an issue and I will add the language to Crowdin.

### Manually adding translations

You can add a translation by copying the English `en` locale
([here](https://github.com/evroon/bracket/tree/master/frontend/public/locales)) directory.
Rename the directory to the name of your locale, and start translating the `common.json` file inside
the directory. It might be useful to use an online tool (Google `translate json file`) to do the
translation for you, and then carefully check and correct any mistakes.
