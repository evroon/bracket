# Cloud services

The frontend of Bracket is powered by Vite and can be simply statically hosted on any cloud
service, such as Vercel or Cloudflare. Vite's [documentation](https://vite.dev/guide/static-deploy)
provides detailed instructions on how to deploy your Vite application.

<Callout type="info">
Essentially, the only thing you (or a cloud provider) needs to do is to run `pnpm run build`
to generate a production build, and then serve the contents of the `dist` directory to the internet.
</Callout>

## Cloudflare

To deploy the frontend to Cloudflare, go to `Workers & Pages` and click on
`Import an existing Git repository`.

Make sure to:

- Select `React (Vite)` as framework
- Select the `frontend` directory as root directory

## GitHub Pages

To deploy the frontend to GitHub Pages, follow the steps outlined in
Vite's [docs](https://vite.dev/guide/static-deploy#github-pages).

## Vercel

To deploy the frontend to Vercel, use the following link:

```text
https://vercel.com/new/project?template=https://github.com/evroon/bracket
```

Make sure to:

- Select `Vite` as framework
- Select the `frontend` directory as root directory

This should work. If it fails, Vercel didn't automatically detect the right build settings.
Change the following settings under `Build and Output settings`:

- Set the build command to `pnpm run build`
- Set the install command to `pnpm install`

## Other cloud providers

Vite's [documentation](https://vite.dev/guide/static-deploy)
provides detailed instructions on how to deploy your Vite application.
